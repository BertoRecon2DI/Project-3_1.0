         <h1>Itinerary</h1>

         <h2>Day 1</h2>
         <p>We start from the foothills above Littleton, Colorado,
            promptly at 9am. The first day is a chance to get
            your legs in shape, test your gearing, and prepare for
            what's to come.
         </p>

         <h2>Day 2</h2>
         <p>Day 2 starts with a climb up Bear Creek Canyon to Lookout
            Mountain, followed by a swift and winding descent into the
            town of Golden. Refresh yourself at the famous Coors Brewery.
         </p>

         <h2>Day 3</h2>
         <p>Day 3 takes you along the Peak to Peak Highway. This
            55-mile route showcases the mountains of the Front Range,
            providing amazing vistas from Golden Gate Canyon State Park
            to Rocky Mountain National Park.
         </p>

         <h2>Day 4</h2>
         <p>Now for the supreme challenge: Day 4 brings some real
            high-altitude cycling through Rocky Mountain National Park
            and up Trail Ridge Road. It's an amazing ride, high above
            timberline, topping out at over 11,000 feet.
         </p>

         <h2>Day 5</h2>
         <p>We start Day 5 on the west side of the Continental Divide.
            From Grand Lake, you'll bike to Winter Park and then over
            Berthoud Pass, and back to the eastern side of
            the Continental Divide.
         </p>

         <h2>Day 6</h2>
         <p>On Day 6 we ride
            back to Littleton over Squaw Pass and Bear Creek and then
            enjoy a celebratory dinner as we share memories of a great
            tour.
